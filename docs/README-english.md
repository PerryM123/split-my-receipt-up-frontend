# Split My Receipt Up (Frontend)

‚Äª [Êó•Êú¨Ë™û„ÅÆREADME.md„ÅØ„Åì„ÅìÔºÅ](./../README.md)üëà

## Why am I Making This?
Instead of calculating receipts by hand, let's use AI's OCR instead to convert a photo of a receipt into a machine-readable text format and calculate it that way!

## What I Want to Learn From Making This?
I've never had the chance to work in the backend of web development so I will take this oppurtunity to use Laravel and make an application following Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles (reference: https://github.com/PerryM123/memories_backend). This repository will be for the frontend and using frontend tools I want to get into. For example: vitest, playwright, tailwindcss, figma, etcÔºâ
